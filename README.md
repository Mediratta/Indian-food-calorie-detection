Accurately tracking calorie intake in modern diets is laborious and error-prone, hindering effective dietary management as manual food logging lacks efficiency and precision, making it challenging for individuals to monitor their dietary consumption effectively.

This system aims to leverage image processing and volumetric analysis to revolutionize calorie estimation, providing a more convenient and accurate method for real-time monitoring of dietary intake. The proposed solution seeks to address the limitations of current tracking methods, offering a transformative approach to empower individuals in managing their diets more effectively.
